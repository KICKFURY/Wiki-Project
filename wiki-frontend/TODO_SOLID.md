# SOLID Principles Refactoring Progress

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- [x] Created `ApiClient` class for HTTP requests
- [x] Created `AuthService` class for authentication operations
- [x] Created `RecursoService` class for resource CRUD operations
- [x] Created `UserService` class for user-related operations
- [x] Created `useAuth` hook for authentication state management
- [x] Created `useRecursos` hook for resource state management
- [x] Created `useFollow` hook for follow/unfollow functionality
- [x] Created validation utilities for form validation logic

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- [x] Created reusable `FormInput` component
- [x] Created reusable `LoadingSpinner` component
- [x] Created reusable `ErrorMessage` component
- [x] Used class-variance-authority for extensible button variants

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- [x] Proper interface inheritance in type definitions
- [x] Consistent API response structure across services

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- [x] Separated concerns into focused interfaces
- [x] Created specific hooks for different functionalities
- [x] Modular service classes with specific responsibilities

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- [x] Services depend on abstractions (ApiClient interface)
- [x] Components depend on hooks, not direct API calls
- [x] Hooks depend on services, not direct implementations
- [x] Created centralized endpoints configuration for better maintainability

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### Component Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor `home.tsx` to use new hooks and services
- [ ] Refactor `create.tsx` to use new hooks and services
- [ ] Refactor `detail.tsx` to use new hooks and services
- [ ] Refactor `profile.tsx` to use new hooks and services
- [ ] Update `index.tsx` to use new authentication flow

### Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for services
- [ ] Create unit tests for hooks
- [ ] Create integration tests for components
- [ ] Add error boundary components

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement React Query for caching
- [ ] Add optimistic updates
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add pagination for large lists

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout the app
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Add ESLint rules for SOLID principles
- [ ] Create documentation for the new architecture

## ðŸ“‹ Architecture Overview

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # Type definitions (ISP)
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/       # Centralized configuration (DIP)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Business logic (SRP, DIP)
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # State management (SRP, DIP)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions (SRP)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ui/  # Reusable components (OCP)
â””â”€â”€ index.ts        # Clean exports (ISP)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Each class/function has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Isolated services and hooks are easy to test
3. **Reusability**: Components and utilities can be reused across the app
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand
6. **Centralized Configuration**: API endpoints are managed in one place for easy maintenance
